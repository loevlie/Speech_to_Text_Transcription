# Attention-based End-to-End Speech-to-Text Deep Neural Network

I used a combination of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) / Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Dense Networks to design a system for speech to text transcription. End-to-end, the system is made to transcribe a given speech utterance to its corresponding transcript.
